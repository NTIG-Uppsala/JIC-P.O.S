## Coding Standard

### General
* Code and file names are written in English.
* All comments are written in English.

### C#
* File names are written in PascalCase.
* Class, struct and record names are written in PascalCase.
* Function names are written in PascalCase.
* Variable names are written in camelCase.
* Block openings are placed beneath expressions or declarations, such as:
   ```C#
        public struct Data
        {

        }
   ```

Refer to the following guides for a more comprehensive C# coding standard:

* [Naming Convention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names)

### JavaScript
* Variables are defined using the `let` keyword.
* Block openings are placed on the same line as the preceeding statement, such as:
   ```JS
      while (true) {

      }
   ```
* Functions are defined using arrow functions:
   ```JS
      const func = () => {

      }
   ```

### SQL
* Table names:
   * Use plural names for tables (e.g., `users`, `roles`).
   * Use underscores to separate words in the table name (e.g., `users_name`, `users_role`).
     
* Column names:
   * For primary key columns, name them id.
   * Use underscores to separate words in the column name (e.g., `user_name`, `user_role`).
   * For data columns, use short descriptive names that represent the data (e.g., `country_name`, `country_code`, `customer_name`), but only use the table name prefix when necessary to avoid ambiguity.
   * For foreign key columns, use the related tableâ€™s name followed by id (e.g., `customer_id`, `employee_id`).
